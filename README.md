Summary: 
I do not take credit for these lecture notes. I am just sharing for anyone who wants to learn about the different optimisation methods. The shared codes I do not claim ownership also.

-Prerequisites: 

The prerequisites for linear: Advanced Calculus and Linear algebra. 

The prerequisites for non-linear especially convex: Advanced Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability Theory and some elements of stochastic processes, real analysis and some functional analysis (although these analysis topics are not important prerequisites but very helpful imo).

Linear Optimisaition:
N\A.

Conic Optimisation:
N\A.

Convex Optimisation: 
The premise of the shared convex optimisation lectures are based on cvx-Book by Stanford, https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/ and it is highly recommeneded to experiment using cvxy python library.The lecture slides do contain elements of Linear Optimisation but, it primarily focuses on the Convex Optimisation focus so that you do not need a background in Linear optimisation for this (although useful but not a strong prerequisite).
This is recommended for electrical engineers (with mathematical maturity) however, I believe applied mathematicians have better background to study this due to the mathematical maturity required.

Update:
I will share more on optimisation methods and another repository on experimenting with different optimisation algorithms primarily on Python.
